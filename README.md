This project combines both javascript (p5.js) and python to create a data visualization of data pulled from the 2021 Stack Overflow Programmers Survey.

You can view the python script by looking at [`./python/notebook.ipynb`](./python/notebook.ipynb), which both displays what I'm doing, the code, and the results.

This is a deployment from a p5.js project created in the online editor. All credits for the p5.js enviornment used goes to [processing/p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js), and the use of the [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

This project was created as an assignment for Game Design 140, Creativity and Computation, at Quinnipiac University.
